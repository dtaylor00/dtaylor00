            <span>This is a project to convert a Latin-script sentence (abcd...) to a Kishimu-script sentence. The
                Kishimu-script is an alternative writing system for a fantasy species known as Kishimus and was created
                by Paradoxum. Check out more of her work and art here: </span><a
                href="https://www.instagram.com/paradoxum_art/">https://www.instagram.com/paradoxum_art/</a><span>. The
                Kishimu script uses an alphasyllabary (or abugida) system whereas the Latin script uses an alphabet
                system. Alphasyllabary is similar to an alphabet, but its vowels are not full standalone symbols.
                Instead, the vowels must be appended or attached to a consonant. The Kishimu script has two more main
                differences compared to Latin script. The first, words in a sentence are written without break (similar
                to cursive). The second, sentences are read from top to bottom and right to left. The script and example
                is below:
